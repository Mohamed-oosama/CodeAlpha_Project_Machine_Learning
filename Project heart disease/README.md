# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project develops a **Machine Learning Model** to predict whether a person is likely to have **heart disease** based on their medical attributes.  
It helps in **early detection** and supports **healthcare professionals** in decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict the presence of heart disease using patient health records.  
- Apply and compare multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Evaluate performance using different metrics.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset includes **patient health information** such as:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol Level  
- Resting ECG Results  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- Exercise Induced Angina  
- ST Depression (Oldpeak)  
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy  
- Thalassemia Result

## 🛠 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Feature scaling & encoding  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizations of features vs target variable  
   - Correlation heatmaps  

3. **Model Training & Testing**  
   - Split dataset into train & test sets  
   - Train different ML models  
   - Optimize with hyperparameter tuning  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - ROC-AUC Curve  

---

## 📊 Results
- Compared performance of multiple classifiers  
- Identified the most accurate and reliable model for heart disease prediction  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Deploy the model as a **web app** (using Streamlit/Flask).  
- Improve accuracy with **Ensemble Learning**.  
- Use **Deep Learning models** for better prediction.
