# ✍️ Handwritten Character Recognition using CNN

## 📌 Overview
Handwritten Character Recognition is a classic problem in the field of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**.  
This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically recognize handwritten characters (digits or alphabets) from image data.  

By leveraging the power of deep learning, the system can achieve high accuracy in classifying handwritten characters, which has practical applications in:
- Automated form processing
- Postal code recognition
- Bank cheque processing
- Document digitization

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a CNN model capable of recognizing handwritten characters with high accuracy.  
- Preprocess and normalize image data for robust training.  
- Visualize the learning process (loss & accuracy curves).  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.  
- Provide a simple prediction function for real-world use cases.
